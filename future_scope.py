    ### Future Enhancements
    The Smart Ad Screen project has a promising future with several potential improvements:

    1. **Emotion Detection:** Integrating emotion detection technology could enhance ad targeting by considering the viewer's emotional state. This could lead to more engaging and effective advertisements.
    
    2. **Expanded Dataset:** Increasing the diversity of the training dataset can improve the model's accuracy and robustness across different demographics and fashion styles.
    
    3. **Real-time Feedback Mechanism:** Implementing a feedback system to gather viewer responses and interactions with the displayed ads. This data could be used to optimize ad targeting and assess ad performance.
    
    4. **Enhanced Fashion Analysis:** Developing more sophisticated fashion classification models to recognize a wider range of clothing styles and accessories.
    
    5. **Integration with Augmented Reality (AR):** Exploring the use of AR to overlay virtual elements or information based on the detected profile, further enriching the advertising experience.
    
    6. **Scalability:** Adapting the system for deployment in various settings such as retail stores, shopping malls, and public spaces, with scalability considerations for handling large numbers of viewers and ads.
